# i3-dotfiles

A spacious, minimal, vim-friendly i3 configuration. (`$mod+h/j/k/l` navigates windows).

Install the pre-requisites with `Setup.sh`

Install [theme-magic](https://github.com/jcaw/theme-magic) to make the color schemes synchronize from Emacs.

Have fun, and share screenshots of different configurations!
